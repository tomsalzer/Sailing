# Approaching boat inspection day

## The boat
Through the help of a sailing friend, I was able to locate a 1986 Catalina 34 in good (but not great) condition. This particular boat was not advertised for sale; the owner was "thinking of selling her." We started a conversation, she gave me the location and slip number, and I went to take a look.

## Condition is good, not great
Some of the lines on the boat weren't stowed. The lines looked like they owners had just gone sailing yesterday, dropped the lines where they were, and went home. That didn't really alarm me as what I was seeing was owners who enjoyed using the boat. 

What did disturb me is that all of the open ports I could see had clear silicone sealant around them. That is a sure sign that one or more ports have leaked. I have not yet seen the inside of the boat but that happens on Friday (boat inspection day!) and I expect to see some water damage on the woodwork.

The owner also reported that condensation forms in the strangest places so I'll be on the lookout for mold, mildew, odd smells, and water collected in strange places.
