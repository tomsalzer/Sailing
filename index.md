## Welcome to *Sailing with Tom*

This site chronicles my adventures in purchasing a boat, making repairs and upgrades, and sailing in the Salish Sea.

I have sailed since my pre-teen years: fast little dinghies that were easy to tip over and easy to right, slow dinghies that if swamped were very difficult to get back up, and a Hobie 16 catamaran that was incredibly fun. From there, I graduated to a West Wight Potter 19 that served well for many years.

The Potter carried me all over Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and the San Juan Islands. It was a little bit cramped for a couple but for single handing, it was a great boat.

Now we need more room for our own comfort and to help our offspring and their children learn to enjoy the Salish Sea. A new-to-us, larger boat is in the cards. Welcome to our next adventure.
