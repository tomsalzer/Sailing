## Inspection of the Catalina 34

We finally got to examine the interior of the Catalina 34 sailboat and what we discovered was not particularly good. Some of our findings include:
- The diesel motor was low on oil and when started, the exhaust smoke was blue (and continued to be blue for the time we ran the motor)
- No cooling water being pumped to the diesel motor or pumped out the stern
- Mold and mildew in some places, including two places where wood had mold from long-term water leaks
- When the macerator pump was removed, one of the lines was simply tacked to a vertical member and covered with duct tape
- Standing water found underneath some cushions
- Front hatch had previously leaked, and a previous owner had simply sealed it, cut a hole in it, and installed a smaller hatch that also leaked

In summary, the boat was not in sailaway condition. It proved to be more of a project boat than I can afford. I'm still working full time! I suppose that if I was retired, it could be repaired and updated, but at this point in my life I just don't have time to invest in bringing it up to good condition.

And so, with apologies to the seller, we withdrew our offer. This has impacts for the seller as she had given the marina 30 days notice for the moorage slip. It has impacts for me, too, because I had already paid for insurance on the Catalina and secured moorage for that length of vessel.

## Spur of the moment trip to Port Townshed

The experienced sailor friend who helped me look at the Catalina was aware that I had also been interested in a unique boat for sale in Port Townshend: a Nonsuch 26. He suggested we make the hour drive north to Port Townshend and find the boat.

I reached out to the broker handling the Nonsuch and he said he could not meet with me that day. I let him know we were going to head up and walk the docks.

Once we got there, we started looking at boats in one of the marinas. The first set of docks did not have the boat. When we were partway down the ramp to the second set of docks I spied the distinctive wishbone boom of the Nonsuch and said "there she is!"

## A surprise waited above the Nonsuch

When we got to the Nonsuch, I saw that the cockpit hatch was open. I called out, "ahoy the boat!" and a lady stuck her head out of the cabin. It turns out she is the granddaughter of the deceased owner. We introduced ourselves and she invited us aboard. My friend and I crawled around the boat and found most everything very satisfactory.

## Offer

Standing on the dock with the granddaughter, we told her how much we loved the boat. She called the broker who called my phone. I learned some of the issues that the marine survey had revealed and told him I would make an offer in a certain dollar range. Once we got home, I sent him an email with that offer.

Later that evening, he sent the purchase and sale agreement via DocuSign. I completed it the next morning, and learned later that day that the seller had verbally accepted the offer. That evening, the purchase and sale agreement was executed by the seller. We are "locked in" on the boat!
